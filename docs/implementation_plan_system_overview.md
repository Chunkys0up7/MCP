# Implementation Plan: System Overview - Full Functional Map

This document outlines a phased plan of action to implement features described in the "System Overview - Full Functional Map," bridging the current MCP project state towards that vision.

## Current Project Status (Summary)

*   **UI Layer:** Basic React frontend structure (`frontend/`).
*   **API Gateway:** FastAPI app (`mcp/api/main.py`) for MCPs/Workflows, basic API key auth.
*   **Component Registry:** In-memory registry (`mcp_server_registry`) from `mcp_storage.json`.
*   **Workflow Engine:** Sequential engine (`mcp/core/workflow_engine.py`) using `chain_storage.json`.
*   **Execution Runtime:** MCPs run as local Python processes.
*   **Database Layer:** JSON files in `.mcp_data/`.
*   **MCD System, Advanced Security, Agents, Kubernetes:** Not yet implemented.

## Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Solidify Core Backend and Data Persistence

*   **Goal:** Replace JSON file storage with PostgreSQL and Redis, enhance the component registry, and refine the workflow engine.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Database Setup (`System Overview - Section 6`):**
        *   Set up PostgreSQL. Define SQLAlchemy schemas for `mcp_definitions`, `workflow_definitions`, and `workflow_runs`.
        *   Set up Redis for caching and potentially `workflow_execution_state`.
        *   **Action:** Create `mcp/db/models.py`, `mcp/db/database.py`. Modify `mcp/core/registry.py` and `mcp/api/routers/workflows.py` to use DB sessions.
    2.  **Enhanced Component Registry (`Section 3`):**
        *   Store MCP definitions (configs) and versions in PostgreSQL.
        *   Basic schema validation via Pydantic (at app layer).
        *   **Action:** Update `mcp/core/registry.py` and relevant API endpoints.
    3.  **Refined Workflow Engine (`Section 4`):**
        *   Store workflow definitions and execution history in PostgreSQL.
        *   Improve error reporting and `WorkflowExecutionResult` detail.
        *   Add `depends_on: List[str]` to `WorkflowStep` schema for future DAG support.
        *   **Action:** Update `mcp/schemas/workflow.py` and `mcp/core/workflow_engine.py`.
    4.  **Basic Security Enhancements (`Section 8 partially`):**
        *   Implement user authentication (e.g., JWT tokens).
        *   Store basic user information in DB.
        *   **Action:** Add user models, auth routes, and update API dependencies.

### Phase 2: Foundational UI for Core Workflow & Component Management

*   **Goal:** Create UI views for managing and interacting with core components and workflows.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Component Management UI (`Section 1.2 partially`):**
        *   UI to list, view, create, update MCP definitions from DB.
        *   Form-based MCP configuration editing.
        *   **Action:** Develop React components in `frontend/` for `/context` APIs.
    2.  **Workflow Management UI (`Section 1.3 partially`):**
        *   UI to list, view, create, update Workflow definitions.
        *   Simple step-editor for workflows.
        *   UI to trigger execution and view results.
        *   **Action:** Develop React components in `frontend/` for `/workflows` APIs.
    3.  **Basic Dashboard (`Section 1.1 partially`):**
        *   Simple dashboard showing recent workflows, MCPs.
        *   **Action:** Develop React components.

### Phase 3: Towards Containerized Execution & MCD Introduction

*   **Goal:** Move towards a more robust execution environment and introduce the MCD system.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Containerized MCP Execution (`Section 5 partially`):**
        *   Define contract for MCPs as Docker containers.
        *   Modify/create MCP type to execute MCPs in Docker containers (e.g., via Docker SDK).
        *   **Action:** Update/add MCP execution logic in `mcp/core/`.
    2.  **MCD System - Initial Implementation (`Section 7`):**
        *   Define Pydantic models for MCD structure.
        *   API endpoints for MCD CRUD (storing in PostgreSQL).
        *   Basic UI for creating/editing MCDs (e.g., Markdown editor).
        *   **Action:** New schemas, API router, and React components for MCDs.
    3.  **Logging & Monitoring - Basics (`Section 1.4, 5 partially`):**
        *   Ensure structured logging from FastAPI and Workflow Engine.
        *   Store basic execution logs in PostgreSQL.
        *   **Action:** Improve logging, potentially add dedicated logs table.

### Future Phases (Aligning with Advanced "System Overview" Features)

*   **Phase 4: Advanced Workflow & Execution:**
    *   DAG workflow execution.
    *   Integration with Argo Workflows for orchestration.
    *   Kubernetes HPA for auto-scaling.
    *   ELK Stack for log aggregation.
*   **Phase 5: Full UI/UX Vision:**
    *   Visual Workflow Builder (React Flow).
    *   Component Marketplace with faceted search, sandbox preview, dependency visualization.
    *   Execution Monitor with Gantt charts, resource adjustment, time-travel debugging.
*   **Phase 6: Advanced Security & MCD:**
    *   Full RBAC engine.
    *   Secrets Management (e.g., Vault integration).
    *   MCD RAG system for semantic search and understanding.
*   **Phase 7: Agent Ecosystem & Enterprise Features:**
    *   Autonomous agents (Orchestrator, Validator, Cost).
    *   Dashboard Personalization Engine.
    *   Full Kubernetes deployment strategy for all services.

This plan provides a high-level roadmap. Each phase and task will require further detailed planning and breakdown.
