# Workflow Builder

The Workflow Builder is a visual tool for creating and managing MCP workflows. It provides an intuitive interface for designing, validating, and executing complex workflows.

## Features

### Visual Canvas
- Drag-and-drop interface for adding nodes
- Interactive node connections
- Real-time validation
- Navigation aids (zoom, pan, minimap)
- Validation panel for error checking
- Execution panel for workflow control

### Node Types
1. **LLM Node**
   - Model selection
   - Temperature control
   - Token limits
   - Input/output configuration

2. **Notebook Node**
   - Jupyter notebook integration
   - Kernel selection
   - Timeout settings
   - Input/output mapping

3. **Data Node**
   - Data source configuration
   - Format selection
   - Schema validation
   - Transformation options

4. **Input/Output Nodes**
   - Workflow input definition
   - Output collection
   - Type validation
   - Schema enforcement

### Workflow Execution
- Sequential and parallel execution modes
- Real-time execution monitoring
- Progress tracking
- Error handling and recovery
- Output collection and validation

### DAG Optimization
- Automatic cycle detection
- Parallel execution optimization
- Cost estimation for workflow steps
- Dependency validation
- Execution order optimization

## Usage

### Creating a Workflow
1. Drag nodes from the palette onto the canvas
2. Configure node properties using the property panel
3. Connect nodes by dragging from output to input ports
4. Validate the workflow using the validation panel
5. Execute the workflow using the execution panel

### Node Configuration
1. Select a node to open its configuration panel
2. Set required parameters based on node type
3. Configure input/output mappings
4. Set execution parameters (timeouts, retries, etc.)

### Workflow Validation
The validation panel provides real-time feedback on:
- Required field validation
- Connection validation
- Cycle detection
- Dependency validation
- Schema compliance

### Execution Control
The execution panel provides:
- Start/stop workflow execution
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Step-by-step execution
- Error handling and recovery
- Output collection

### DAG Optimization
The workflow engine automatically:
1. Detects cycles in the workflow
2. Validates dependencies between steps
3. Optimizes execution order
4. Groups steps for parallel execution
5. Estimates execution costs
