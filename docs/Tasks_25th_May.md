# Tasks - 25th May

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Implement DAG Workflow Execution âœ…
- [x] Create DAG workflow engine
- [x] Implement DAG validation and cycle detection
- [x] Support parallel step execution
- [x] Add DAG visualization component
- [x] Update workflow monitor for DAGs
- [x] Add tests for DAG engine and visualizer

### 2. Enhance Component Marketplace (Next)
- [x] Implement faceted search for components (backend /api/components/search endpoint implemented and integrated with frontend)
- [x] Add component preview and metadata display
- [x] Integrate ratings and reviews (backend API endpoints, DB model, schemas, and frontend UI in Marketplace modal)
- [x] Support version compatibility and dependency resolution (backend search endpoint supports compatibility/dependency filters and returns version/dependency info)
- [x] Add advanced filtering and sorting (backend search endpoint supports sorting and advanced filters: author, cost, compliance, etc.)

### 3. Implement Advanced Security Features
- [x] Role-based access control (RBAC) (all routers audited and patched for RBAC enforcement; reviews creation/deletion now role-restricted)
- [x] Secrets management (all secrets/config loaded from env vars or .env; .env.example provided; Vault integration planned)
- [x] Audit logging (audit logs now written for MCP create/update actions; more endpoints to be covered)
- [ ] User management
- [ ] API key management

### 4. Develop Execution Monitor Enhancements
- [ ] Gantt chart visualization for workflow runs
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Time-travel debugging for workflow steps
- [ ] Performance suggestions and bottleneck detection
- [ ] Real-time metrics dashboard

### 5. Container Orchestration Setup
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment scripts
- [ ] Autoscaling and resource management
- [ ] Service mesh configuration
- [ ] Monitoring with ELK stack
- [ ] Deployment documentation

**Notes:**
- All DAG workflow execution features are now complete and tested.
- Component preview and metadata display modal is implemented in FacetedSearchScreen.
- Next up: Integrate ratings and reviews (Task 2.3).
- Continue to maintain test coverage, update documentation, and ensure backward compatibility.
