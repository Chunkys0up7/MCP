# Marketplace UI Test Coverage

## Overview
This document summarizes the automated test coverage for the Marketplace UI feature, as implemented in the file:

- `frontend/src/__tests__/MarketplacePage.test.tsx`

## What is Covered

### 1. Rendering
- The Marketplace page renders with all core UI elements: filter panel, component grid, and detail view.

### 2. Filtering and Search
- Type, compliance, and cost filters update the component list as expected.
- Keyword search filters the component list in real time.

### 3. Component Cards
- Each component is rendered as a card with name, version, type, description, tags, and rating.
- Clicking a card opens the detail view.

### 4. Component Detail View
- The detail view displays tabs: Overview, Dependencies, Sandbox, Versions, Reviews.
- The correct tab content is shown when a tab is selected.

### 5. Dependency Visualizer
- The Dependencies tab displays a robust mock dependency graph (SVG) with accessible labeling.

### 6. Action Buttons
- "Add to Workflow" and "Test in Sandbox" buttons are present and trigger mock actions with confirmation messages.

### 7. Accessibility
- All form controls are associated with labels using `htmlFor` and `id`.
- The compliance filter uses a `fieldset` and `legend` for group labeling.
- The dependency visualizer SVG uses `role="img"` and `aria-label`.
- All major UI elements are accessible by role, label, or placeholder.
- Tests use queries like `getByLabelText`, `getByRole`, and `getByPlaceholderText` to ensure accessibility.

### 8. API Mocking
- All backend API calls (`searchComponents`, `getComponentDetails`) are mocked for deterministic, fast tests.

## Known Limitations / Next Steps
- Tests currently use mock data; integration tests with a real backend are recommended for end-to-end coverage.
- Some unrelated test files in the codebase are still failing; these do not affect Marketplace UI quality.
- Consider adding tests for edge cases (empty state, error state, loading spinners).
- Add visual regression or screenshot tests if pixel-perfect UI is required.

## Test File Location
- `frontend/src/__tests__/MarketplacePage.test.tsx`

## How to View the Marketplace UI

### Local Development
1. Start the frontend dev server:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   - [http://localhost:3000/marketplace](http://localhost:3000/marketplace) (or the route configured in your router)

### Deployed Link
