# AI Co-Pilot for Workflow Builder

## Overview
The AI Co-Pilot is an intelligent assistant that helps users create, optimize, and debug workflows in the MCP system. It provides real-time suggestions, error resolution, and best practice recommendations.

## Features

### Schema Repair
- Detects missing required fields
- Validates field types and formats
- Suggests corrections for schema violations
- Provides confidence scores for suggestions

### Workflow Optimization
- Identifies parallel execution opportunities
- Suggests performance improvements
- Analyzes resource utilization
- Recommends workflow restructuring

### Error Resolution
- Pattern-based error detection
- Context-aware solution suggestions
- Historical error resolution tracking
- Confidence-based recommendations

### Best Practices
- Workflow design guidelines
- Error handling recommendations
- Resource management suggestions
- Security best practices

## Usage

### Basic Setup
```python
from mcp.components.ai_copilot import AICoPilot

# Initialize the co-pilot
copilot = AICoPilot()

# Analyze a workflow
workflow_data = {
    "name": "example_workflow",
    "nodes": [...],
    "edges": [...]
}

suggestions = copilot.analyze_workflow(workflow_data)
```

### Error Resolution
```python
# Get suggestions for an error
error_data = {
    "type": "connection_timeout",
    "message": "Failed to connect to database",
    "node_id": "node1"
}

suggestions = copilot.suggest_error_resolution(error_data)
```

## Suggestion Types

### Schema Repair Suggestions
- Missing required fields
- Invalid field types
- Format violations
- Schema version mismatches

### Optimization Suggestions
- Parallel execution opportunities
- Resource optimization
- Performance improvements
- Workflow restructuring

### Error Resolution Suggestions
- Connection issues
- Timeout handling
- Resource exhaustion
- Dependency conflicts

### Best Practice Suggestions
- Error handling patterns
- Resource management
- Security considerations
- Code organization

## Implementation Details

### Suggestion Generation
1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Parse workflow configuration
   - Identify potential issues
   - Calculate confidence scores

2. **Suggestion Phase**
   - Generate actionable recommendations
   - Prioritize by impact and confidence
   - Provide implementation guidance

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Verify suggestion feasibility
   - Check for conflicts
   - Assess potential side effects

### Confidence Scoring
- Based on historical success rates
- Pattern matching accuracy
- Context relevance
- Implementation complexity

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python scripts/test_ai_copilot.py
```

The test suite verifies:
- Workflow analysis
- Error resolution
- Suggestion generation
- Confidence scoring

## Integration

### Workflow Builder
- Real-time suggestions during workflow creation
- Inline error resolution
- Best practice recommendations
- Performance optimization hints

### Error Handling
- Automatic error detection
- Context-aware suggestions
- Resolution tracking
- Success rate monitoring

## Best Practices

1. **Suggestion Management**
   - Review suggestions before implementation
   - Consider confidence scores
   - Validate against requirements
   - Monitor suggestion effectiveness

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error catching
   - Provide detailed error context
   - Track resolution success
   - Update error patterns

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize suggestion generation
   - Cache common patterns
   - Prioritize critical issues
   - Monitor system impact

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **False Positives**
   - Solution: Adjust confidence thresholds
   - Review suggestion patterns
   - Update validation rules

2. **Missing Suggestions**
   - Solution: Add new patterns
   - Update analysis rules
   - Review error contexts

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Solution: Optimize analysis
   - Implement caching
   - Reduce check frequency
